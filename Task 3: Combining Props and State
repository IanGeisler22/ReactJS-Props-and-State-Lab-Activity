1. Create a new ReactJS component called Person that takes a name prop and a age prop,
and displays the person's name and age.
2. In the App component, render the Person component with different name and age props.
3. Create a new ReactJS component called PersonList that maintains a list of Person
components and displays them in a table.
4. Implement a button to add a new Person component to the PersonList component.
5. Implement a button to remove a Person component from the PersonList component

import React from "react";
import Person from "./Person"; // assuming you have a "Person" component defined in a separate file

const PersonList = ({ persons }) => {
  return (
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Age</th>
          <th>City</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {persons.map((person) => (
          <tr key={person.id}>
            <td>{person.name}</td>
            <td>{person.age}</td>
            <td>{person.city}</td>
          </tr>
        ))}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  );
};

export default PersonList;
